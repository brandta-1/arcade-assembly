  ### Description:

  - This is a project where users can form groups for games they want to play, no matter how old or oudated they be. There will be multiple pages for this application such as: Home, Login/Signup, Profile, Find A Group/Search Game.
  - The home page will have a brief overview of our basic functionality plus maybe a list of current games that have the most groups/players/played. The home page will have a nav bar that will take you to the other pages but will ultimately force you to signup/login (will submit F/L Name, Email, and gamertag/username) before being able to go to the Profile or Find a Group/Search Game section. Once logged in, the Login/Signup spot on the navbar will change to a LogOut button.
  - The Profile page will have your user info along with favorite/most recent games played along with a friends/pinned players section for easy gaming access. The Find a Group/Search Game page will let you filter and search for games or groups by a few different genres and desires for certain groups (casual players, ranked/competitive, new players) before allowing you to join up with them for gaming fun. Database will store login info and user info stored on their profile.
